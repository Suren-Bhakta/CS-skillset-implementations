# CS-skillset-implementations

## About

This repository is a culmination of all the skills that I have ammassed in the coding language python. Some files were done within the classroom while others were created outside of school. The scope of this repository will be focused on data structires and algorithms.


## Projects

1. [2d array manipulation](https://github.com/Suren-Bhakta/CS-skillset-implementations/blob/main/2dArray.py)

  - Upon file input with given dimension and coordinates, will create a 2d array with a spiral of numbers starting with "1" in the center.


2. [encryption/decryption algorithms](https://github.com/Suren-Bhakta/CS-skillset-implementations/blob/main/encrypt.py)

  - Upon file input, will append the string to a 2d array based off length then encrypt the message by rotating the array.
  - Decryption follows the same procedure but rotates the 2d array counterclockwise.


3. [Object Oriented Programming](https://github.com/Suren-Bhakta/CS-skillset-implementations/blob/main/oop.py)

  - Fundamental creation of classes in python to determine employee salaries.


4. [Various Search Algorithms](https://github.com/Suren-Bhakta/CS-skillset-implementations/blob/main/search.py)

  - Creation of binary and linear search algorithms to determine minumum lines of code capable of being written based off input file of test cases and productivity factor.


5. [Circular Linked List](https://github.com/Suren-Bhakta/CS-skillset-implementations/blob/main/circular.py)

  - Use of circular linked list to solve famous josephus problem.


6. [Expression Tree](https://github.com/Suren-Bhakta/CS-skillset-implementations/blob/main/Expression.py)

  - With input of ecpression from file, creates standard expression tree with outputs prefix and postfix


7. [Binary Search Tree Manipulation](https://github.com/Suren-Bhakta/CS-skillset-implementations/blob/main/bst.py)

  - Use of various methods to calculate various attributes of a given bst



8. [DFS/BFS](https://github.com/Suren-Bhakta/CS-skillset-implementations/blob/main/dfs:bfs.py)

  - With the creation of an adjacency matrix, fill a given image (via file input) with search algorithms listed above


9. [Topo Sort](https://github.com/Suren-Bhakta/CS-skillset-implementations/blob/main/topologicalsort.py)

  - Use of stack and queue to determine if a cycle exists. If so, run topological sort.


10. [Dynamic Programming](https://github.com/Suren-Bhakta/CS-skillset-implementations/blob/main/dp.py)

  - Sample dynamic programming to determine max amount of ROI on houses from sample file input.
